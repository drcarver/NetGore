This project contains both the static data files and 
the DataContext for the database.  It is a mixture 
of code generated files from the databases and hand
written files.  

All Random Tables are created from the standard random
table class which includes the dice to roll on the table
and the ability to select a particular entry by numer
of name.  Named entries are tied back to a enmerted type
for each entry in the table.
